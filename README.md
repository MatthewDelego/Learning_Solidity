# Learning_Solidity
I used CryptoZombies to learn how to create a random zombie generator. The program uses Solidity contracts on etherium. When a user inputs a name into the name space, the program genetares a random zombie.

learned about:

Tokens, the ERC721 standard, and tradable assets/zombies
Libraries and how to use them
How to prevent overflows and underflows using the SafeMath library
Commenting your code and the natspec standard
