# Learning_Solidity
I used CryptoZombies to learn how to create a random zombie generator. The program uses Solidity contracts on etherium. When a user inputs a name into the name space, the program genetares a random zombie.

<h3>Advanced Solidity Concepts</h3>
 zombie generated and new name change is now implemented.

 We've added a way to update our CryptoKitties contracts
We've learned to protect core functions with onlyOwner
We've learned about gas and gas optimization
We added levels and cooldowns to our zombies
We now have functions to update a zombie's name and DNA once the zombie gets above a certain level
And finally, we now have a function to return a user's zombie army
